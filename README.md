In this project I explored a few datasets to gather some insights on traffic accidents in Belgium.

What can be found using my visualisations is

first it looks at some general information about these traffic accidents:
How have they progressed between 2017 and 2021

How do their occurances fluctuate during the day and throughout the week
Comparing population data Which Blegian provinces are least traffic safe

My main two points of interest are 

Where are vulnerable road users most at risk for being involved in traffic accident

This is shown as a the ratio of such accidents compared to the total of number of accidents. 
This shows a clear trend where rural areas are safer and urban less safe.

additionaly it can be seen that during the covid-19 pandemic the proportion of vulnerable road users increased, while earlier seeing an decrease in overall accident likely due to restricted movement of motorised vihicles during that time.

Lastly during this time an unseen increase in working from home occurred. realising that one can not simply look at any decrease in overall accidents 
and attribute it to WFH since car movement was restricted, an alternative was to look at differences between provinces in the rates of workers WFH. This shows a noticable pattern showing fewer rates in provinces with higher WFH rates.
