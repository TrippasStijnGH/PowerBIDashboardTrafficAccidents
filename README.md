# Power BI Traffic Analysis

## Overview

This project uses Power BI to analyse traffic accident data in Belgium, exploring patterns across time, geography, and road user types. The analysis combines multiple datasets including accident records (2017–2021), population statistics, and work-from-home survey data to uncover insights about road safety trends and contributing factors.

## Preliminary Exploration

The first section examines general patterns in traffic accidents: how have they progressed between 2017 and 2021?

How do accident occurrences fluctuate during the day and throughout the week? And comparing with population data, which Belgian provinces are least traffic safe?

## Vulnerable Road Users

Where are vulnerable road users (cyclists, pedestrians) most at risk of being involved in a traffic accident?

This is shown as the ratio of such accidents compared to the total number of accidents. The data reveals a clear trend: rural areas are safer for vulnerable road users, while urban areas present higher risk.

Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic the proportion of accidents involving vulnerable road users increased, despite an overall decrease in accidents — likely due to restricted movement of motorised vehicles during that time.

## Work From Home Impact

During the pandemic, an unprecedented increase in working from home occurred. Realising that one cannot simply attribute any decrease in overall accidents to WFH (since car movement was restricted anyway), an alternative approach was taken: comparing differences between provinces in both WFH rates and accident rates. This reveals a noticeable pattern — provinces with higher WFH rates show fewer accidents.
